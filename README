The Task Management API is a backend system developed using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).  
It provides authenticated users with the ability to create, organize, and manage their tasks efficiently.  
Each user has their own set of categories and tasks, ensuring complete data isolation and privacy.

This project also includes comprehensive API documentation through Swagger UI for easy testing and interaction.

This API is designed to help users manage their daily tasks by offering features such as:

- Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Task categorization for better organization
- User-specific access (users can only view and manage their own data)
- Filtering, searching, and ordering of tasks
- Automatic task status management (complete, incomplete, overdue)
- Comprehensive API documentation with Swagger and Redoc

## Key Features

- Authentication: Secure login and token-based authentication system using JWT.
- Task Management: Create, update, delete, and filter tasks.
- Categories: Group related tasks into user-defined categories.
- User Isolation: Each userâ€™s data is private; no cross-access between users.
- Overdue Tracking: Automatically detects and flags overdue tasks.
- API Documentation: Built-in Swagger UI for exploring and testing endpoints.

## Technology Stack

- Framework: Django 5.x, Django REST Framework
- Authentication: SimpleJWT
- Documentation: drf-yasg (Swagger, Redoc)
- Database: SQLite (default, easily replaceable with PostgreSQL or MySQL)
